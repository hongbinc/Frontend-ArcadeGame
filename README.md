![](http://progressed.io/bar/100?title=Progress)

## Project Objective:
You will be provided visual assets and a game loop engine; using these tools you must add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.

##What I have Done:
- Utilized JavaScript's object oriented programming features to write "Enemy" and "Player" classes to create instances of objects.
- Deployed a pseudoclassical pattern.

## How to play:
- Press 'Left', 'Right', 'Up', and 'Down' on Keyboard to play.
- Reaches the water: Game is win.
- Collides with an enemy: Game restart.
